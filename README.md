Projects in the field of signal processing

1)Nut Detection:
walnut chickpeas and hazelnut nut varieties are detected by the algorithm developed using the functions in the opencv library.
2)Activite Detection:
Running, walking and stopping human activities were distinguished using the welch spectral estimation method by passing the accelerometer signals through a low-pass filter.
