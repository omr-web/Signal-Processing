# Signal-Processing
Projects in the field of signal processing

# 1) Nut Detection:
walnut chickpeas and hazelnut nut varieties are detected by the algorithm developed using the functions in the opencv library.

# 2) Activite Detection:
Running, walking and stopping human activities were distinguished using the welch spectral estimation method by passing the accelerometer signals through a low-pass filter.

# 3) DigitalSignalProccesing

These are applications carried out in the digital signal processing course.
Includes basic signal processing topics such as DTFT, Z transform, up sampling , down sampling, sampling, convolution
